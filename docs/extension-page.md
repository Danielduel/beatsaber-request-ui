This extension allows users to search for maps using beatsaver, supports desktop and mobile.
On mobile, it is a panel which viewer can use after tapping on the extension icon above the chatbox.
On desktop, it renders as stream overlay.
Autogenerated maps are hidden by default.
_Note:_
Mobile panel works only on Android devices, it is like that because the Apple ecosystem requires a yearly fee (developer license) to run an extension.
_Warn:_
This extension doesn't hide when you are streaming something else than Beat Saber.
